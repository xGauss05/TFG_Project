# Lights Out Project

## Repository
https://github.com/xGauss05/TFG_Project

## Before playing
Only works on Windows.
Make sure you have the Steam app installed on your PC and logged in.
If the game does not work, in any web browser type:
```cmd
    steam://install/480/
```
It should prompt an installation in you Steam app of *Spacewar!*. There's no need to install it, but it is necessary to register it on your account.
To check if it's registered correctly, go to Library and search for *Spacewar!*.

It is recommended to add Lights Out.exe at Steam, by Add a Game... > Add a Non-Steam Game... > Browse... and select Lights Out.exe in order to use the Steam's interface.
